<font size="5"><p>Hi, welcome to Food Grove! We are dedicated to helping people who can't afford food, get food. We connect you with your local restaurants, doughnut shops, and bakeries near you, so you can help those who can't afford one of the three neccessities, survive. When you join our team, we offer community service hours when you work with us.</p></font>
